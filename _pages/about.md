Hi! I am currently a second year Ph.D. student at the [New Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), [School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://ai.ucas.ac.cn), supervised by Prof. [Zhaoxiang Zhang](https://zhaoxiangzhang.net/). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from Nankai University in 2023, majoring in intelligent science and technology.

My research focuses on computer vision and pattern recognition, particularly on the following topics:

 - LiDAR-based Object Detection
 - Label-efficient Learning
 - 3D Reconstruction
 - Video Generation
