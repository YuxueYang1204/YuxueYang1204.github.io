Hi! I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at the [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), [School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://ai.ucas.ac.cn), supervised by Prof. [Zhaoxiang Zhang](https://zhaoxiangzhang.net/). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from Nankai University in 2023, majoring in intelligent science and technology.

 My research focuses on computer vision and pattern recognition, particularly on the following topics: 
 
 - LiDAR-based Object Detection
 - Label-efficient Learning
